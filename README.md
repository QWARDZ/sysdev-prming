# CYBOARD

## Statement of the Problem

- Students in Iloilo City have a hard time finding boarding houses.
- Finding one takes about 2-3 weeks.
- Many students donâ€™t know the price, location, or what is included.
- No websites show all boarding houses in one place.

## Objectives

- To make a simple prototype to help students find boarding houses.
- To let owners add basic details like name, price, and location.
- To let students see the list and search for a place they want.
- To save students time and effort in finding a boarding house.

## Scope and Limitations

### Scope

This project will focus only on boarding houses in Iloilo City. Owners can add details like name, price, location, and contact number. Students can view the list and search to find a place that fits their needs.

### Limitations

The system is just a simple prototype with basic functions. It will not have online payments or a mobile app. The list of boarding houses will only show what owners share.
